            A React todo application is a simple web app that allows you to create, read, update, and delete a list of tasks using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. A React todo app typically consists of the following components:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A text input field where you can type a new task and add it to the list by pressing enter or clicking a button.
                </li>
                <li>A list of tasks that shows the task name, a checkbox to mark the task as completed, and a delete button to remove the task from the list.
                </li>
                <li>A filter option that lets you choose to see all tasks, only completed tasks, or only active tasks.
                    There are many tutorials and examples on how to build a React todo app using different approaches and technologies</li>
